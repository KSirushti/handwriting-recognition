# Real-Time Assistive Handwriting Recognition System

This project is an AI-powered handwriting recognition assistant designed to help users classify handwritten A‚ÄìZ characters in real-time. It features a canvas-based UI for drawing, backend-powered prediction using the Roboflow API, and supports user corrections to continuously improve the model.
